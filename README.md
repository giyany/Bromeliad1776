# Bromeliad1776 target capture bait set

Bromeliad1776 is a target sequencing probe set to enrich 1776 single and multi-copy genic regions across Bromeliaceae. The design, detailed in Yardeni et al. 2021 (preprint), is based on Ananas comosus v.3 gene models. The probes target various random loci in addition to genes putatively associated with key innovations within the family, common phylogenetic markers and genes potentially differentially expressed in C3/CAM species.
